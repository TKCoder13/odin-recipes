        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cooking the perfect steak can be the most painful
            experience for the unexperienced.  It looks easy, but 
            sometimes it can be intimidating for a beginner.  Today, 
            we will be learning how to prepare for the meal during 
            all stages. From shopping for an affordable but tasty 
            chunk of protein all the way to cleaning tips.  Look 
            forward to learning about a student's experience on how 
            to cook the perfect steak.

        <h2>Prerequisite Ingredients</h2>

        <p>Before we get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter or Oil (whatever you prefer)</li>
            <li>Cooking Pan</li>
            <li>Cooking Utensils (Ex. Tongs)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick out steak of choice (For beginners, I would
                recommend something without a bone like Sirloin Steak)
            </li>
            <li>
                Put steak in freezer with packaging of choice (I would recommend Ziploc bags) (If you plan on 
                cooking the same day, skip Steps 2 & 3)
            </li>
            <li>
                Defrost steak at least a few hours before cooking (Tip: If you
                forgot to do this, place packaged steak into a bowl of warm water)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Steak Rarity</h2>
        <img src="../images/steak-rarity.jpg" alt="Different Steak Rarities">
        <p><strong><em>Before cooking, pick out a steak rarity that you want to aim for,
            the less you let the steak cook, the rarer/juicier the steak will be.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat pan to a <strong>medium-high</strong> heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow your butter or oil to preheat by placing it 
                onto the pan
            </li>
            <li>
                While waiting for the pan to heat, preseason the steak
                with salt
            </li>
            <li>
                To test if the pan is ready, wet the tips of your 
                fingertips with water and flick some into the pan.  If the 
                water drops sizzle and jump around, the pan is ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place your steak into the pan and allow it to sear for <strong>3-5 minutes</strong>
                 (or until your liking)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once that side has a nice char to it, flip the steak to the other 
                side. Allow it to sit for another <strong>3-5 minutes</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Once the steak has finished cooking, place the steak onto a plate 
                and let it rest for at least 5 minutes to retain the juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                While letting the steak rest, take a paper towel and wipe the
                remaining stuff off of the pan (with tongs) to help reduce time 
                spent cleaning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wash and dry your pan and clean the cooking surfaces of the oils 
                generated from cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy your steak!
            </li>
