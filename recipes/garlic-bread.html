            <em>"This is a story, a fairytale if you will, of three 
            of the greatest foods in the world coming together.  
            Butter, garlic, and bread... We combine them together
            to make something greater than the sum of its parts."</em>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup of Unsalted Butter (220g)</li>
            <li>4-6 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup of Parsley (Italian Flat Leaf)</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup of Parmesan Oregano (Cheese)</li>
            <li>Bread (Chibatta Loaf recommended)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees 
                Celsius) or your airfryer to similar temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
                Soften your Butter in the microwave (20-40 seconds).
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely chop Garlic. Mix Garlic and Butter into a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your finely chopped Parsley into the mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grate your Parmesan Oregano into the mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix everything together until the mixture is evenly spread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut your Bread in half to maximize surface area (for
                <strong>maximum spread</strong>) and spread the Garlic Butter 
                Mixture onto the nicely cut bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place your Buttered Up Bread onto a baking sheet and place
                that into the oven for <strong>10-12 minutes</strong> (For 
                airfryer, it may take longer, look for a toasted golden 
                brown finish).
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice the bread into 1x1" chunky pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test your creation and add seasoning as needed.  Enjoy!
