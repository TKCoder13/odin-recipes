The objective of this project is tobuild a basic recipe website.

(This will be my first project in the Odin Project introduction lessons.)

So far, I have learned about the basics of HTML.  This includes:

- HTML Boilerplate
- Elements and Tags
    - Title and Body Elements (Heading, Body, etc.)
    - Text Elements (p, strong, em, h1, comments, etc.)
    - Nesting Elements
    - Lists (li, ul, and ol)
    - Links and Images (absolute and relative paths)

I have also learned more about Git and how to write proper commmit messages.  The Seven Rules of a Great Git Commit Message:
    1. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject with a period
    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain the 'what' and 'why' vs. 'how'
